        Signal Flow is an annual 4-day music festival held at Mills College. Every aspect of the festival, from the website and poster design to the lighting and sound at the 
        concerts, is organized and run by graduate students in the Music Department. 
        Not only is the festival an opportunity for second-year students to showcase their work and to share it with a wider audience, it is also a chance to bring together
        the larger Mills community over four days of installations and concerts. Since its inception, Signal Flow has only grown and has become emblematic of the experimental
        spirit of the Music Department and the Center for Contemporary Music. We hope to see you there this March.
