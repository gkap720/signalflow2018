	Seiyoung Jang (b. 1993) is a Korean-American composer and maker currently 
	based in San Leandro, CA. She aims to celebrate manifestations of organic 
	forms in resistance against thoughtless sterility, with a focus on inter-/intrapersonal 
	psychological processes, communication, and coloration. She has studied with 
	Matthew Burtner, Judith Shatin, Ted Coffey, Peter Bussigel, Luke Dahl, Pauline Oliveros, 
	John Bischoff, and Laetitia Sonami, among others. Seiyoung's works have been performed 
	at the 2017 SEAMUS National Conference at St. Cloud State University, MN, as
	well as the 2017 NSEME at Louisiana State University, LA. Seiyoung is currently
	pursuing a M.F.A. in Electronic Music and Recording Media from Mills College in 
	Oakland, CA and previously obtained a B.A. in Psychology and Music from the 
	University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA.
