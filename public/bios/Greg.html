		Greg Kappes (b. 1994) is a musician, improvisor, and multimedia artist 
		based in Oakland, CA.  His works explore data and technology, communication 
		and mediation, and the posthuman. 
		These works take the form of performances, installations, and 
		projections inspired by and created in collaboration with our 
		silicon-based friends. Greg is pursuing his MFA in Electronic Music and Recording Media.
