	Kris Force is a composer, improvisor and performer of electroacoustic music 
	and a new media artist living and working in the San Francisco bay area. 
	Kris works as a solo artist and collaborator. Her work utilizes forms including 
	sound, installation, drawing, painting, performance, video art and new media. 
	In her practice, the transformation of media characteristics through processes 
	of decay, duplication, juxtaposition, materiality, signal and transmission, 
	and the possibility of capturing the liminal moment of transformation, is an
	ongoing pursuit. Kris is interested in the medium taking on its own intelligence, 
	apart from her creation, thereby employing living signals, sympathetic resonances, 
	procedural processes, generative algorithms and self realizing systems. Kris 
	is pursuing her MFA in Electronic Music and Recording Media.
