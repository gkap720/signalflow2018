	Composer and performer, Ricky Crews (b.1989), grew up in rural Missouri. 
	He received a BM degree in composition from Southeast Missouri State 
	University, where he studied composition with Robert Fruehwald, saxophone 
	with Michael Dean, and flute with Paul Thompson. The composer was then among 
	the first to be admitted to the San Francisco Conservatory of Music’s 
	newly-minted Technology and Applied Composition department. Now at Mills 
	College, Crews focuses on repurposing the works of Berkley-based composer 
	John Adams. In July 2017, Sarah Cahill and Crews performed 40 Years After 
	China Gates, a reimagination of John Adams’s China Gates, written in 1977 for Cahill.
