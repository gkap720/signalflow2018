	Adam Sohn is a field recordist, sound designer, and electronic musician 
	based in San Francisco with a background in dance and hip hop music production 
	and audio engineering. Since receiving his bachelorâ€™s degree in Recording Arts, 
	his practice has broadened to include fixed composition experiments that fuse 
	synthetic and real-world sounds to explore human life in the technological 
	era and recover the withering shreds of nature and tranquility that remain.
