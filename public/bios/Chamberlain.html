	Chamberlain Zhang is a Chinese electronic musician, DJ, improviser, poet
and sound artist. Coming from a background as an experimental techno DJ,
he tells stories by manipulating sounds while performing and composing. <br><br>
Chamberlainâ€™s music and poetry are highly based on the idea of
transcendence, using sounds to describe things that are larger,
approaching something, leaving something, being mentally affected by
something, imagining and creating those and other scenarios. He explores
sounds integrated with movement and spatiality, producing sonic
architecture that remains.<br><br>
I believe the task of any art is to connect human beings to their higher
nature - c.z.
