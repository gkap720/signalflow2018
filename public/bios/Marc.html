		(Born 1990. Sao Paulo, Brazil) Marc discovered a passion for music at an early age, beginning guitar lessons at 6. Two
years later, he moved with his family to Los Angeles where he developed an interest in Jazz. He studied classical guitar
with Matthew Greif (Los Angeles Guitar Quartet), before moving to Boston to further pursue his musical studies at the
Berklee College of Music. There he studied composition with Marti Epstein and guitar with Jon Damian. Marcâ€™s main
musical influences come from both the traditional and avant-garde movements in Jazz, classical, and Brazilian music.
