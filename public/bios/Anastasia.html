	Anastasia Clarke (b. 1987) is an electronic music composer, sound designer, 
	vocalist, performer, and interdisciplinary artist from New York. Conceiving 
	performance as a modality for improving the quality of human experience, she
	is concerned with articulating the many healing and therapeutic efficacies 
	of the live medium. Anastasia is currently a 2018 MFA candidate in Electronic 
	Music and Recording Media at Mills College, where she has been conceiving 
	musical instruments that call for visceral interaction between performers 
	and interface.
